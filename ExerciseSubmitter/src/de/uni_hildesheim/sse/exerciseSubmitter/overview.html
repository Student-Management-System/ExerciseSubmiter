This project realizes an exercise submission and replay mechanism for arbitrary
exercise submission servers. As a default implementation, submission to a structured
SVN repository is implemented (requires <i>task</i>/</i>username</i>) structures in the
repository. Readable directories on second level are available for replay (as corrected
submissions), read- and writable directories on second level are available for submission.
The main configuration of the program can be stored in a system directory (to be unmodifiable
for users) or in the main directory of the installation or jar file. For further details on the
configuration c.f. <code>de.uni_hildesheim.sse.exerciseSubmitter.configuration.IConfiguration</code>
and the documentation of the individual plugins.<br/>
The following lines show an example configuration (in <code>c:\windows\exerciseSubmission.ini</code>, 
<code>/etc/exerciseSubmission.ini</code> or the main directory of the bundling jar file where
the classes of this program are packed in):
<pre>
debug = true
protocol.1 = svn
svn.server = https://192.168.36.128/svn/test/
review = file
review.storeInExercise = true
review.resubmitExercise = true
</pre>
Short description: debugging is enabled, one submission server using the SVN protocol is specified,
reviews will be stored in file (using the file review protocol). When a review is done, the results
will be stored in the exercise (ready for resubmission). Thereby, the reviewed exercise annotated
by <code>// REVIEW</code> comments will automatically be resubmitted to the (all) submission server(s). 
Individual submission/review protocols may introduce further options.
